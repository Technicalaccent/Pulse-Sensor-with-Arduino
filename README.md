# Pulse Sensor with Arduino


-> Can you tell blood pressure from a pulse?


The pulse will give the basic information required to estimate the systolic blood pressure (the upper number of blood pressure readings). Keep in mind, that this is a very rough estimate and only indicates if the systolic blood pressure is not low. Blood pressure monitoring should be done with a cuff and a stethoscope.



-> What is systolic and diastolic in blood pressure measurement?


Blood pressure is measured using two numbers: The first number, called systolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart rests between beats.


-> What is neural control of blood pressure?


Neurological regulation of blood pressure and flow depends on the cardiovascular centers located in the medulla oblongata. This cluster of neurons responds to changes in blood pressure as well as blood concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other factors such as pH.


-> What is an HRM sensor?


Heart rate monitor (HRM) is a personal monitoring device that allows one to measure/display heart rate in real-time or record the heart rate for later study. It is largely used to gather heart rate data while performing various types of physical exercise
